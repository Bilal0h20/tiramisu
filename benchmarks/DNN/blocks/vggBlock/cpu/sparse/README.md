The files in this folder are organized as follows:

    General
        clean.sh : remove some useless files.
        compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh : compile MKL-DNN code and run it.
        configure.h: define some configuration constants.

    Tiramisu
        vgg_block_generator_tiramisu.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

    Wrapper
        wrapper_nn_block.cpp: wrapper file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.

    Intel MKL-DNN
        vgg_block_generator_mkldnn.cpp : code that calls Intel MKL-DNN VGG block.

To run this benchmark:

    At the directory build/benchmarks/DNN/blocks/vggBlock/sparse execute
	    make

    sparse_vgg_block_wrapper executable will be created in the current directory.

    To compare the result of tiramisu with MKL-DNN execute :
        ./compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh
    then
        ./sparse_vgg_block_wrapper


    execution results could be found in the text files :
        mkl_result.txt (Intel MKL-DNN)
        tiramisu_result.txt (Tiramisu)
